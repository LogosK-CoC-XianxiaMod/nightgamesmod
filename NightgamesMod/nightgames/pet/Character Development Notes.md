This document records some ideas for character development that I may return to some day.

Pet mechanics:
===

Angel:
---
    Late game based around having one really strong pet that can command the opponent's attention and stay between
    the opponent and Angel so she can focus on her tease damage at a distance.  She should have ways of keeping the 
    pet alive, but forcing her to focus on her pet limits her damage output.  Weak to strategies that distract her pet.
    
    Necessary changes: 
    * Remove ability for multiple pets (send to Cassie)
    * Other changes
    
Cassie:
---
    Late game based around having many weaker pets and overwhelming the player through strength of numbers.  Weak to 
    skills that deal damage to the whole team.  No way to improve her pets, but succeeds through correct choice of pet
    to the situation.
    
    Necessary changes:
    * Ability for multiple pets (take from Angel)
    * Other changes
    
Reyka:
---
    Late game flexibility when it comes to pets. Imps can be summoned in various sizes and strengths, with a limit
    on her total summon strength.  Something like choosing between 4 smaller summons, 2 medium sized ones, or one larger
    one.  Summoning past a certain point should start to inflict costs on the summoner, reflecing the costs of using
    dark magic.  No ways to assist summons, and they usually function to grant Reyka a chance to recover from the costs
    of using her Dark magic.
    
    Necessary changes:
    * Cap summon strength for Dark magic summons.
    
Airi:
---
    Clone line late game based around splitting Airi into multiple smaller copies.  She can fight as one large combatant
    or various sizes of smaller ones.  The skills available to each clone vary based on it's size, forcing her to choose
    between one powerful move, or many smaller ones.
    Necessary changes:
    * Cap total biomass that Airi can work with
    * Cap total number of clones that Airi can command.

All of these put the fetish goblin in a bit of an odd place.  I don't really want Eve to work around summoning, because
it's not really thematic for her.  I'll leave the goblin in for now, but I kind of expect her to go away at some point
and be replaced by a larger size of an imp.
