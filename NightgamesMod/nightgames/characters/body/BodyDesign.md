Body Design Doc

Purpose: The goal behind the Body system is to allow players to 1) customize their character and 2) 
gain an advantage in combat. The appendage being used in combat will modify how the characters 
combat choices affect their opponent.

Overview
---
The body is laid out into a tree structure. The first level is the chassis. This might take the form
of something like a head, a torso and legs. For Airi, this might be a head, a torso and an 
amorphous mass. Between these cases, the head and the torso have exactly the same number of 
part slots available to them. This simplifies body construction from a mechanical perspective. 
However, legs and an amorphous mass may have entirely different mechanics. Legs would likely afford 
more mobility at the cost of the number and type of appendages they can accommodate.

Appendages can themselves hold components. Continuing with the torso example, Mara's backpack could 
attach to her torso via the "back" slot.  However, she could not also have wings, as they also 
occupy the back slot. Forcing the characters to make strategic choices keeps their relative power 
in check.
