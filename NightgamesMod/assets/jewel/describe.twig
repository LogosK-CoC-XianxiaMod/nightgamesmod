Something has changed about Jewel's demeanor, though it's hard to put your finger on it.
Her body has always been toned, but now she seems like a weapon in human shape. She carries a calm
composure subtly different from her normal arrogance. Her movements are deliberate and fluid,
like you imagine a martial arts master would look.

Something has changed about Jewel's demeanor, and you're very sure it's not good. It's hard to put
your finger on it, but despite her toned, human-weapon like body, she seems to have a dark
composure to her. Behind what looks like a calm composure is a violent and cruel arrogance. Her
movements are deliberate and fluid, like a martial arts master, but with the cruelty and brutality
of a demon. You might have made fun of her before, but whatever's gotten into her doesn't care
for games or love.

Jewel has one of the most appropriate names you've ever. Her eyes are as bright green as emeralds
and her long ponytail of hair is ruby red. The combination makes her strikingly beautiful despite
not bothering with any make-up. Her body is fit and toned, with almost no fat. She practically
radiates confidence. By her expression alone, it's like her victory is already assured.
