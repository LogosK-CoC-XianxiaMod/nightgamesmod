It's easy to forget that Kat's older than you when she looks like she's about to start high school.
She's a very short and slim, though you know she's stronger than she looks. Adorable cat ears poke
through her short, strawberry blonde hair. She looks a bit timid, but there's a gleam of desire
in her eyes.
