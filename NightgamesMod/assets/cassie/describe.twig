{% if (self.has(Trait.witch)) %}
{{ self.subject() }} has changed a lot since you started the Game. Maybe {{ self.pronoun() }} isn't
that different physically. {{ self.pronoun() }} has the same bright blue eyes and the same sweet
smile. The magic spell book and cloak are both new. {{ self.pronoun() }}'s been dabbling in the
arcane, and it may be your imagination, but you feel like you can perceive the power radiating
from {{ self.objectPronoun() }}. {{ self.possessiveAdjective() }} magic seems to have given
{{ self.objectPronoun() }} more confidence and {{ self.pronoun() }} seems even more eager
than usual.
{% else %}
{{ self.subject() }} is a cute {{ self.guyOrGirl }} with shoulder-length auburn hair, clear blue
eyes, and glasses. {{ self.pronoun() }} doesn't look at all like the typical sex-fighter.
{{ self.pronoun() }}'s short but not chubby: you would describe {{ self.possessiveAdjective() }}
body as soft rather than athletic. {{ self.possessiveAdjective() }} gentle tone and occasional
flickers of shyness give the impression of sexual innocence, but {{ self.pronoun() }} seems
determined to win.
